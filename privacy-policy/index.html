    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <small>Last updated: 05/22/2021</small>
    <p>
      <em>
        This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
        collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from
        <a href="https://riddey.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          https://riddey.com
        </a>
        (the "Site").
      </em>
    </p>
    <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain
      information about your device, including information about your web
      browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are
      installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we
      collect information about the individual web pages or products that
      you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site,
      and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to
      this automatically-collected information as "Device Information."
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Cookies" are data files that are placed on your device or
        computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For
        more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
        <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          http://www.allaboutcookies.org
        </a>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        "Log files" track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
        including your IP address, browser type, Internet service
        provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Web beacons", "tags" and "pixels" are electronic files used to
        record information about how you browse the Site.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase
      through the Site, we may collect certain information from you,
      including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment
      information (including but not limited to credit card numbers),
      email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as
      "Order Information."
    </p>
    <p>
      When we talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we
      are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
    </p>
    <h2>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h2>
    <p>
      We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill
      any orders placed through the Site (including processing your
      payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with
      invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this
      Order Information to: Communicate with you; Screen our orders for
      potential risk or fraud; and When in line with the preferences you
      have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising
      relating to our products or services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
      potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
      generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by
      generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact
      with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
      advertising campaigns).
