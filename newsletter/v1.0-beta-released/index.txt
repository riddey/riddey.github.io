======================================
GOODBYE COOLBOARD, SAY HELLO TO RIDDEY
======================================

During the last couple of months, many fantastic and exciting things happened to us that we want to share with you.

-----------------------
MEET RIDDEY, THE WOMBAT
-----------------------

Our original intention was to create a whiteboard that makes people's life easier by its superior UI. 
Then we recognized that we could do more. So we extended our scope from just a whiteboard to a visual collaboration
space. To reflect this shift, we decided to rebrand: from Coolboard, a "cool" whiteboard, to Riddey. The new name is
easier to remember and is less loaded.

Our mascot is Riddey, the wombat (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat).

MEET RIDDEY, THE WOMBAT
-----------------------

We have been working very hard since the last release to deliver as much value as possible. So I proudly announce that
our private beta is up and running. You need an invite to sign up, so if you don't have but want one, you request
it here:

HIGHLIGHTS
----------

Renewed selection frame
-----------------------

We completely reimplemented how selection works to make it easier for you. It now supports three main modes:
resize, move, and rotate. 

Invitation
----------

We added invitations to the system so that our users can invite their friends to Riddey. They also can track the
invitation status.

Log in with Google
------------------

Google approved our application, so from now both "Log in" and "Sign up" with Google work like a charm. 

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

We added keyboard shortcuts to allow blazing-fast interactions. You can change colors, move selected shapes, and many
more things.

For the complete list, please read the release notes (https://riddey.com/blog/announcments/v1.0-beta-release-notes?utm_campaign=v1.0-beta-released&utm_source=newsletter).

Thank you,
the Riddey team
