      renewal either through your online account management page or by
      contacting Company customer support team.

      Company with accurate and complete billing information including
      full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid

      Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change

    <p>
      We will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in
      Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
      Subscription before such change becomes effective.
    </p>
    <p>

      Subscription Fees can be paid by your choice with a credit card,
      PayPal or other payment method available on the site. All prepayment
      methods and tariffs will be reflected in your user account.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not store or collect your payment card details. That
      information is provided directly to our third-party payment
      processors whose use of your personal information is governed by
      their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the
      standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
      Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard,

      secure handling of payment information.

      you will not be entitled to refund as well, neither of its full or
      partial cost.
    </p>

      grant of a license, not a transfer of title.
